a friend said that if i started a blog, he'd read it. i've been playing around with static site generators the last week and i decided to go with [hugo](http://gohugo.io).

i'm not great at writing and i'm not even sure i have a lot to say, but at the least i should post some interesting links.

i'm going to have to work on this theme a little, though -- i'm not a big fan of truncated posts in the index.
