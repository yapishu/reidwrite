[![](/img/urbit.jpg#thumb-right)](/img/urbit.jpg)i used a sizeable chunk of change to pre-purchase a [star](https://urbit.org/posts/address-space/) from [urbit](http://urbit.org/).

> In Urbit, network identities are cryptographic property, like Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is money and Ethereum is law, Urbit is land.

> Urbit is designed to become a digital republic: a network of individually owned nodes with no central point of control. Like a well-planned city, the friendly network is decentralized but connected, safe but free.

what is urbit? what *exactly* it will be remains to bee seen, but in broad strokes it's an attempt to rebuild the internet from the ground up, using a massively distributed encrypted virtual machine. namespace immutability and absolute individual control of data are major components, but i'll leave the more granular explaining to [this](https://www.popehat.com/2013/12/06/nock-hoon-etc-for-non-vulcans-why-urbit-matters/) popehat essay, which is how i was introduced to urbit a few years ago:

> First someone will rewrite Tor in it – a trivial exercise. Then some silly toy-like web browser and maybe a matching web server. They won't get much traction. Then someone will write something cool – a decentralized jukebox that leverages Urbit's privileges, delegation and neo-feudalist access control lists to give permissions to one's own friends and family and uses the built in cryptography to hide the files from the MPAA. Or maybe someone will code a MMORPG that does amazingly detailed rendering of algorithmically created dungeons by using spare cycles on the machines of game players (actually delegating the gaming firms core servers out onto customer hardware).

> Probably it will be something I haven't imagined.

> And then, five, ten, or twenty years from now, the new architecture will really start catching on. More and more computation will slide into the black, beneath the waves. SilkRoad will have no central server – parts of it will be running our your machine, copper-top. Amazon will still be in the cloud computing business…and so will your wrist watch. All sorts of interesting problems that we don't even think about right now because they're so intractable will become easy.

an official (but less pensive) description of urbit can also be seen [here](https://urbit.org/posts/overview/).

urbit, bitcoin, ethereum, and probably other technologies that don't exist yet will be the foundation of the next iteration of the internet: decentralized, emancipatory, and beyond the scope of worldly authority -- governmental, corporate, or otherwise. information gets to be free.

of course, the fact that its development is headed by [curtis yarvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin) (aka [mencius modlbug](https://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/), a major intellectual figure of the new outer right) has caught a lot of people's critical attention. whatever you think of his politics, i think it's indisputable that he's fiercely intelligent. i'm not the only one that isn't spooked by his writing, either -- urbit has backing from a16z and peter thiel, among others.

here's hoping that i'll be a filthy rich digital slumlord in a decade or two; but i also find these ideas genuinely exciting and want to participate in them -- decentralization of the internet has fascinated me ever since i first learned about bittorrent at age 14, when trying to conceptualize a distributed system that could evade all attempts at censorship or control was so  intellectually thrilling that it pushed me to really get into computers and networking initially.

so here's my little bet on the future -- definitely impulsive, possibly a waste of money, but i'm excited to watch this happen over the long haul.
