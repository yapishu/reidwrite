i've been spending the last couple of weeks trying to dive into learning vim, and i've made at least a little progress. in the `misc links` section of link roundup last week, i pointed to [my vimrc](https://github.com/yapishu/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc). i've been incrementally adding features to it, and it's really been shaping up -- i have a default layout and color scheme i genuinely enjoy using, and i've remapped a few shortcuts most recently.

[![](/img/myvim.png#thumb-right)](/img/myvim.png)i'm only just beginning to learn the vim syntax -- the way it uses [verbs, nouns and modifiers](https://yanpritzker.com/learn-to-speak-vim-verbs-nouns-and-modifiers-d7bfed1f6b2d#.vrghiywou), and i'm genuinely impressed with some [examples](http://blog.extracheese.org/2010/11/screencast-custom-vim-refactorings.html) i've seen of what it's capable of. i'm putting this post together as a collection of resources i've saved, to pass along to anyone interested in giving it a shot.
