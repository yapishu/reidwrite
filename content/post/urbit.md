[![](/img/urbit.jpg#thumb-right)](/img/urbit.jpg)i used a sizeable chunk of change to pre-purchase a [star](https://urbit.org/posts/address-space/) from [urbit](http://urbit.org/).

> In Urbit, network identities are cryptographic property, like Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is money and Ethereum is law, Urbit is land.

> Urbit is designed to become a digital republic: a network of individually owned nodes with no central point of control. Like a well-planned city, the friendly network is decentralized but connected, safe but free.

what is urbit? what *exactly* it will be remains to bee seen, but in broad strokes it's an attempt to rebuild the internet from the ground up, using a massively distributed encrypted virtual machine. namespace immutability and absolute individual control of data are major components, but i'll leave the more granular explaining to [this](https://www.popehat.com/2013/12/06/nock-hoon-etc-for-non-vulcans-why-urbit-matters/) ~~popehat~~ clarkhat essay, which is how i was introduced to urbit a few years ago. go read it before you finish reading this post! but if you don't, here's the exciting part:

> First someone will rewrite Tor in it – a trivial exercise. Then some silly toy-like web browser and maybe a matching web server. They won't get much traction. Then someone will write something cool – a decentralized jukebox that leverages Urbit's privileges, delegation and neo-feudalist access control lists to give permissions to one's own friends and family and uses the built in cryptography to hide the files from the MPAA. Or maybe someone will code a MMORPG that does amazingly detailed rendering of algorithmically created dungeons by using spare cycles on the machines of game players (actually delegating the gaming firms core servers out onto customer hardware).

> Probably it will be something I haven't imagined.

> And then, five, ten, or twenty years from now, the new architecture will really start catching on. More and more computation will slide into the black, beneath the waves. SilkRoad will have no central server – parts of it will be running our your machine, copper-top. Amazon will still be in the cloud computing business…and so will your wrist watch. All sorts of interesting problems that we don't even think about right now because they're so intractable will become easy.

an official (but less pensive) description of urbit can also be seen [here](https://urbit.org/posts/overview/) -- or, if you're impatient, this very broad 4 minute overview [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M04AKTCDavc).

what i purchased, a star, is one of ~64k stars that will eventually exist on the urbit network, each with the ability to delegate ~64k 'planets', which are intended to be individual human identities. so, i'm buying [address space](https://urbit.org/posts/address-space/) -- one sixty-four thousandth of the eventual total. hopefully in the long term, this can be parlayed into some kind of business arrangement, but of course i'd like to take care of my friends and nudge them into what could be stepping stone to a much better future internet.

the network architecture follows cascading hierarchy: galaxies delegate stars, stars delegate planets... you get it. so, as a star owner, i'll be delegating planets in the (distant?) future.

* `urbit name space hierarchy` (table roughly yanked from that last link^)

type | number | role | example name
--- | --- | --- | ---
galaxy | 255 (8bit integer) | supernode router | ~syd
star | ~64K (16b) | supernode router | ~delsym
planet | ~4B (32b) | human identity | ~mighex-forfem
moon | 2^64 (64b) | devices | ~dabnev-nisseb-nomlec-sormug
comet | 2^128 (128b) | network bots |  ~satnet-rinsyr-silsec-navhut--bacnec-todmeb-harwen-fabtev

urbit, bitcoin, ethereum, and probably other technologies that don't exist yet will be the foundation of the next iteration of the internet: decentralized and emancipated from its current constraints and weaknesses.

plus: the name of urbit's development group, tlon, are named for a [borges story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tl%C3%B6n,_Uqbar,_Orbis_Tertius) -- `Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius`.  borges has been my favorite writer of fiction for years, since i first found him by way of ted chiang. incidentally, the story's premise is something *remarkably* similar to the concept of [hyperstition](https://hyperstition.al/about/), the namesake for this blog's domain. the kabbalistic implications are simply beyond my ability to ignore! :stuck_out_tongue:

of course, the fact that its development is headed by [curtis yarvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin) (aka [mencius modlbug](https://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/), a major intellectual figure of the new outer right) has caught a lot of people's critical attention. whatever you think of his politics, i think it's indisputable that he's fiercely intelligent. i'm not the only one that isn't spooked by his writing, either -- urbit has backing from a16z and peter thiel, among others.

i find these ideas genuinely exciting and want to participate in them -- decentralization of the internet has fascinated me ever since i first learned about bittorrent at age 14, when trying to conceptualize a distributed system that could evade all attempts at censorship or control was so thrilling that it pushed me to really get into computers and networking initially.

so here's my little bet on the future -- definitely impulsive, possibly a waste of money (five hundo! woof), but i'm excited to both participate and watch this happen over the long haul.

personal addendum:

i'm going to be gone for the weekend -- visiting family in SC -- but i plan to use this blog to write about my experience with urbit (in addition to current regular features, and whatever else i want to post here) as time goes on. i've only barely played with it thus far -- i'm waiting for some computer components to come in the mail, which should arrive while i'm gone, but i'll likely be playing with a comet come next week.

i also intend to get through as much of [unsong](http://unsongbook.com) as i can while i'm on my trip. wish me luck!
