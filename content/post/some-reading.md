no link list this week -- i haven't had the time, and may not for a week or two, we'll see. but in the meantime, i've uploaded a copy of the notes from one of my classes -- _contemporary middle east_, an anthropology class i'm taking that is easily my favorite of the semester. the notes are [here](/mideast.html), they're not terribly long and they're very engaging in my opinion, especially if you have an interest in islam and iran.

(also, look how pretty these notes are -- even nice tables! i use  [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) to take notes and it has an awesome export to html function)
