continuing my theme of identity construction via media consumption, i've also spent the last couple of years building up a pretty impressive subscription list of podcasts.

i subscribe to over one hundred at this point, but the nice thing about subscribing to so many is that you'll always have something you at least kind-of want to listen to, even if none of your favorites have new episodes.

also -- the really great thing about podcasts is that you can use them to drown out your thoughts every moment of the day that you'd otherwise be stuck alone with them :hear_no_evil:

search for these in your podcast client -- the patreon subscription ones won't show up though, obviously. btw, the mediafire links are maintained by me -- **please don't share them**! or at least mirror them yourself first.

[radio war nerd](https://www.patreon.com/radiowarnerd/posts) | john dolan (aka gary brecher) & mark ames, old [exile](http://exiledonline.com/) crew guys, talk about war, history, current events, and john's tour of e. euro hovels (free downloads [here](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/4j7fplyvfagv5/RWN))
[cum town](https://soundcloud.com/cum-town) | the only podcast i regularly crack up at -- easily the funniest thing being produced right now, imo ([bonus ep dl's](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/h5n3riq5sa99a/CTP))
[chapo trap house](https://soundcloud.com/chapo-trap-house) | rounding out the big three twitter podcasts -- a couple of ex-lfs who make incel jokes, basically. it's alright
[sean's russia blog](http://seansrussiablog.org/) | russian history and current events -- really solid interviews by an academic
[zero squared](http://dietsoap.podomatic.com/) | douglas lain from zero books -- plenty of esoteric leftist shit but sometimes it's good, just go on the ep description
[sword & scale](http://swordandscale.com/) | obnoxiously melodramatic narrator sometimes, but probably the best true crime podcast
[99% invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/) | the topic is the world of design, but it's usually just interesting 20th c history; this guy runs a podcast network with a few other good shows, the memory palace is good if you like this one
[war college](https://soundcloud.com/war_college) | reuters-run, hosted by the guy who does [war is boring](https://warisboring.com/) -- US military & global conflict topics
[future strategist](https://soundcloud.com/user-519115521) | future-oriented science that does some 'third rail' topics like intelligence & genetics. infrequent updates :(

[waking up](https://www.samharris.org/podcast) | sam harris' podcast. dont click if u muslim
[crimetown](https://gimletmedia.com/crimetown/) | slightly over-produced series about providence RI organized crime in the 70s. it's a little cute sometimes but it's fun listening
[jordan peterson podcast](https://soundcloud.com/jordanpetersonpodcast) | peterson is a psychology professor at uni of toronto who's made waves in the last year. his lectures are really superb, typically tying psychology to ethics, morality, history, and philosophy -- i recommend starting [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Xc2_FtpHI&t=6043s) for the if you're unfamiliar

i didn't bother listing the npr shows, they're out there if you like them though. i'm partial to radiolab and open source.
