this houthi nasheed is really catchy:

{{< youtube CwlZvg-K9rk >}}

the introduction is pretty funny too ("we will send [the saudis] back to their home in tel aviv!", lol).

an interesting note is that due to religious prohibitions, sunni nasheeds (eg, [isis' famous theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nIN6Ciw1Ws)) do not use instrumentation, only human voice and reverb. i looked up whether beatboxing was haram, and apparently it is indeed [discouraged](https://islamqa.info/en/193426). shia nasheeds, eg the above, can use instruments. some tend to be sparse, like the percussion in the embedded song, but many of hezbollah's seem to use full ensembles -- though not their [most well known](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nIN6Ciw1Ws).

if you're interested in nasheeds in jihadi culture, the excellent (though seemingly defunct) podcast jihadology spoke about the topic on their [final episode](http://jihadology.net/2016/02/29/jihadology-podcast-nasheeds-history-and-cultural-meaning/).
