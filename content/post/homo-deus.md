last night, i finished yuval noah harari's *[homo deus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Deus:_A_Brief_History_of_Tomorrow)*, "a brief history of tomorrow" -- the follow up to his excellent [sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind), which in a few hundred pages, recounts the history of the human species. while i recommend the book to anyone interested in technology, futurism and post-humanism, i'd also include notice that on a personal level i was left deeply disconcerted.

harari's book is broken into three parts:

  - part one is a brief account of how humans have taken over the world, familiar territory because i read this on the tail end of *sapiens*.  

  - part two

  - part three

a major point in this book's favor, in my view, is that it is written in very straightforward and conversational language, despite some ideas so far-seeing they induce vertigo. a bright and eager high school student could likely absorb the entire work without external reference. i'm not one for purple prose or getting lost in ambiguous metaphors, so i appreciate the style.

while harari seems to take pains to avoid taking explicit political positions, some may find a few of his philosophical positions offensive. religious people of any stripe will likely find his simple brushing past of sacred cows to be , though he doesn't belabor the point. this points to harari's tendency to paint his (sometimes contentious) interpretations in [just-so stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story), taking for granted, for the sake of narrative and brevity, debates that are by no means settled. if one is able to look past this penchant, it's for the best.
