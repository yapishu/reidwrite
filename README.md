# reidwrite

## my blog

this is my personal blog, which i'm generating with [hugo](http://gohugo.io/). i'm using github both as a backup and a way to stay fresh on remembering how to use git, because my knowledge has atrophied.

for my blog, i use a modified version of the [after dark](http://themes.gohugo.io/after-dark/) theme. i didn't change a lot, just stripped away a few things. credit to josh badhas for the really excellent minimal theme though!
