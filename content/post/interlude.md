a minor hiccup this weekend: i messed up the wifi configuration on my laptop, and decided it would be easier to just reinstall the OS than figure out how to fix it. i made backups beforehand, but managed to forget to save my hugo folder. it wasn't a huge deal: i'd already started committing my blog to [github](https://github.com/yapishu/reidwrite), but it hadn't been including my theme files which were tweaked enough to make it a pain in the ass to reconfigure. that said, i think i'm back to where i was on friday evening at this point.

lazy weekend, though, the main event was my girlfriend and i watching a few movies with another friend on saturday:

- [my friend rockefeller](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4465220/) (2015), a movie about [christian gerhartsreiter ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Gerhartsreiter), a serial conman who impressively managed to fool, variously, rich LA suburbanites into thinking he was minor nobility, a japanese woman he had a relationship for seven years that he met at a job selling eurobonds, and the nyc art scene into thinking he was a rockefeller and art collector -- all of this despite being a native german who managed to conceal his accent very convincingly. only busted when the cops got at him for killing a dude twenty five years later. there doesn't seem to be much of a net presence for this docu, but it's on netflix.

- [lo and behold](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lo_and_behold_reveries_of_the_connected_world/) (2016), herzog jawn about the internet. very good film but only middling for herzog, i think. much more optimistic about the nature of the internet than i am.

- [spoorloos](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1036630_vanishing) aka the vanishing (1988) -- an old favorite. dutch/french thriller about a man's search for his missing girlfriend. no spoilers, but this is absolutely my top pick for the genre. *No. This time there was another golden egg flying through space. And if we were to collide, it'd all be over.*

pretty good selection for one afternoon, imo.

[![](/img/scrot-th.png#floatright)](/img/scrot-full.png) and on my gay computer shit tip: i've been playing around with using an [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) desktop setup. it takes a little getting used to -- mainly switching constantly between monitors -- but i don't think it takes long to see why it can be much faster than using the mouse to activate windows. there's a much deeper hole to dive into as far as customization than i've gotten into so far, but i've already tweaked it a little -- added a few startup programs, reduced borders between windows to 1px, and set up media buttons to work. my dotfile is on github as well, [here](https://github.com/yapishu/dotfiles). example desktop dedicated to terminals included in the screenshot next to this paragraph -- the tool i used for sysinfo at the right is [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch).

and, something i'm excited about: a new [clark](http://throttleclark.com/) album next month. [first single](https://soundcloud.com/throttleclark/peak-magnetic) on soundcloud. clark and opn are the most exciting electronic acts currently active, imo, and this single sounds fantastic.
